# Fabric Example Mod

This is a fork of the Fabric Example Mod, modified to utilize the [kotlin-graphics/imgui library](https://github.com/kotlin-graphics/imgui).

The R key should open the Demo GUI up.

The gradle files need special attention due to [kotlin-graphics/imgui/issues/112](https://github.com/kotlin-graphics/imgui/issues/112).

## Setup

For setup instructions please see the [fabric wiki page](https://fabricmc.net/wiki/tutorial:setup) that relates to the IDE that you are using.
